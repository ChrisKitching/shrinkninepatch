# shrinkninepatch

A small program to optimise nine-patches.

The concept is simple: nine-patches contain rows or columns of repeated pixels. These regions need only be 1 pixel wide
(or, in the case of multiple scaled regions, a small but proportion-preserving number of pixels). This program does that.
